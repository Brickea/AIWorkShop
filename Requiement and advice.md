# Requirement and advice

Hello all,

Thank you again for your interest to volunteer for our event: AI Workshop with EM Lyon. As a reminder, the event will take place on **Thursday, Dec 5, from 1 - 3 pm at Snell Library 123.**

You will find the instructions to create the notebook as below. As mentioned before, you are welcome to form groups and work together.

1. Create a python notebook that develops a stock price predictive model using Reinforcement Learning, python and TensorFlow. How does one develop a notebook? Look at the many existing GitHub tutorials and books that have working models. For example, type 'reinforcement learning for stock prediction GitHub' into Google.  

2. Use stock API from [AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/).You can use the code in this [notebook](https://github.com/ninadsubhedar/StockPredictionWithLSTM/blob/master/StockPricePredictionWithLSTM.ipynb) to grab the data.

3. Get one or more Deep RL models working on stock data that you download. 
We highly recommend to refer to these tutorials as well when developing the notebook:
*  [MIT 6.S191: Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://youtu.be/i6Mi2_QM3rA) 
*  [Stanford CS234: Reinforcement Learning | Winter 2019 | Lecture 1 - Intro...](https://youtu.be/FgzM3zpZ55o) 
*  [Reinforcement Learning Series Intro - DeepLizard](https://youtu.be/nyjbcRQ-uQ8)  

4. Send your notebook by midnight on **Nov 30** to Prof Nik Brown 

5. Prof Nik will choose/combine and update the notebooks to give details on the maths and algorithms involved.

6. We will meet as a group on **Tuesday, Dec 3**, (time and place is TBA) to discuss on the final notebook as well as your role as TA during the event.

If you have any questions on creating the notebook, please let us know. We are counting on all of you to make this event a success! Thanks again for your time and effort!


Thanks,
Ann
