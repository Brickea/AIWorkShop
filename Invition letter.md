# Help with AI workshop at Northeastern with EM Lyon Business School

NEU AI Skunkworks is doing an AI workshop at Northeastern for EM Lyon
**Dec 5 from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM** at **Snell Library 123**

The workshop will be a hands-on exploration of using **Deep Reinforcement Learning** to optimize ad placement in digital marketing.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

We need help in creating **jupyter notebooks** teaching Deep Reinforcement Learning with **marketing data**.

We also need TAs on the day of the workshop that work with the EM Lyon Business School students for the lab portion of the workshop.
