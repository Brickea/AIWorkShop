# Workshop Introduction

Nov 16, 2019, 9:33 PM (23 hours ago)

to Abhishek, AI, Abhi, Kailash, jain.he, Xiaoyu, Ashwin, Abhishek, Dhruv, me, Ann, Prabhu

The workshop will be 
1. a 20 minute overview of Deep Learning
2. then a 40 minute lecture on deep reinforcement learning.

The lecture part will be very similar to this

MIT 6.S191: [Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://youtu.be/i6Mi2_QM3rA)  

... the last hour will be a lab on deep reinforcement learning.

We need students to find nice github tutorials on deep reinforcement learning. Then clean them up and apply to a different data set.

We are particularly interested in examples of deep reinforcement learning for optimization.

For example, given a budget and a choice of X stocks, use deep reinforcement learning to come up with a policy that decides how much to invest in each stock.
