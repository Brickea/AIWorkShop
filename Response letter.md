# Hello

Thank you for your interest in helping our group for the "AI Workshop with EM Lyon Business School". As mentioned in the email, we are looking for TAs to assist participants during the event, and also to create notebooks for them to use during the event. As there are not many volunteers, we prefer that you help us in both roles, but if you are only interested to do one of the role, thats fine too.

If you prefer to be the TA, we will schedule a meeting a week before the event to discuss your role.

If you prefer to develop the notebook, we will send you the data for you to try some form of reinforcement learning. You are welcome to work independently or form groups to work together. We will then sit together to choose or combine notebooks to be used in the event.

Please let me know your role preference by Monday, so we can proceed accordingly.
If you have any questions about the event, please do not hesitate to let us know.

Thanks,
Ann
