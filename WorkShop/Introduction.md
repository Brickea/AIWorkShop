# Hello all,

Thank you for your support to the event. Unfortunately we will not be meeting today for a meeting with the TA, but we will be meeting tomorrow at the event. As a reminder, the event will take place at **1pm tomorrow**, **12/5 at Snell Library 123**.

I am not sure how many of you can make it to the event tomorrow, so if you can send me your confirmation, that will be great.

As for the preparation tomorrow, we ask you to familiarize yourself with the notebook (see below line) that is going to be used tomorrow so that you can help the participants if they have any problems during the session.

We will gather as a team around 12:30pm so we can assign your location during the event. While you are helping out the group, you will also be exposed to the knowledge from the workshop as well. So please take this opportunity not only to teach but also to learn.

## Context

The materials for the [NEU Skunkworks EM Lyon Workshop](https://github.com/nikbearbrown/NEU_Skunkworks_EM_Lyon)

It is a 3-hour workshop so the reinforcement learning for lift prediction needed to be cut.

This workshop has two notebooks:

1. Predicting Ad Lift with a Neural Network

2. Predicting Ad Lift with an Ensemble of Machine Learning Algorithms

## Additional information

I'll talk for 30-40 minutes on each notebook then the TAs will lead a group playing with the notebooks for 20-30 minutes. That will be done twice.  Notebook one in hour one and notebook two in hour two.

We will divide the number of attendees by the TAs. If 10 TAs show up and there are 40 attendees then there will be groups of four.

The main thing is to be able to run and understand the notebooks.
